  PowerManagementProcessor:
    type: arm7m
    description: Power Management Processor.  Provides ARM Cortex-M processor for
      power sequencing and interfaces directly with the PMGR.  Among its other talents,
      it manages the multi-button reset and DFU process using configured values for
      `volume-up-debounce` and `volume-down-debounce`.  There have been reported copies
      of debug firmwares in the wild which might avoid such power sequencing.

      the eUICC or eSIM Contains a ZIP file with various hash specifiers, each containing two directories.  One `recovery` is seemingly empty (strange as this would imply a bad eUICC can never be recovered but also is consistent with observed behaviour of a eSIM surviving DFU recovery).  Update seems to contain two folders "main" and "gold".
      These folders contain a `firmware.der` as well as a `profile.bin`
      These folders contain a number of "root keys" as defined in the eUICC spec.
