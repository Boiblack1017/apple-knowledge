  auxi:
    title: Auxiliary Image4 Manifest Hash (`auxi`)
    description: After the system verifies that the UAKL hash matches what’s found
      in the `auxp` field of the LocalPolicy, it requests that the AuxKC be signed
      by the Secure Enclave processor application that’s responsible for LocalPolicy
      signing. Next, an SHA384 hash of the AuxKC Image4 manifest signature is placed
      into the LocalPolicy to avoid the potential for mixing and matching previously
      signed AuxKCs to an operating system at boot time. If iBoot finds the auxi field
      in the LocalPolicy, it attempts to load the AuxKC from storage and validate
      its signature. It also verifies that the hash of the Image4 manifest attached
      to the AuxKC matches the value found in the auxi field. If the AuxKC fails to
      load for any reason, the system continues to boot without this boot object and
      (so) without any third-party kexts loaded. The auxp field is a prerequisite
      for setting the auxi field in the LocalPolicy. Users change the auxi value implicitly
      when they change the UAKL by approving a kext from the Security & Privacy pane
      in System Preferences.

      kexts are included in the AuxKC. `smb2` is a prerequisite for setting this field.

      a kext from the Security & Privacy pane in System Preferences.

  auxr:
    title: Auxiliary Kernel Collection (AuxKC) Receipt Hash (auxr)
    description: The `auxr` is an SHA384 hash of the AuxKC receipt, which indicates
      the exact set of kexts that were included into the AuxKC. The AuxKC receipt
      can be a subset of the UAKL, because kexts can be excluded from the AuxKC even
      if they’re user authorized if they’re known to be used for attacks. In addition,
      some kexts that can be used to break the user-kernel boundary may lead to decreased
      functionality, such as an inability to use Apple Pay or play 4K and HDR content.
      Users who want these capabilities opt in to a more restrictive AuxKC inclusion.
      The auxp field is a prerequisite for setting the auxr field in the LocalPolicy.
      Users change the auxr value implicitly when they build a new AuxKC from the
      Security & Privacy pane in System Preferences.

  lpnh:
    title: LocalPolicy Nonce Hash (lpnh)
    description: The lpnh is used for anti-replay of the LocalPolicy. This is an SHA384
      hash of the LocalPolicy Nonce (LPN), which is stored in the Secure Storage Component
      and accessible using the Secure Enclave Boot ROM or Secure Enclave. The raw
      nonce is never visible to the Application Processor, only to the sepOS. An attacker
      wanting to convince LLB that a previous LocalPolicy they had captured was valid
      would need to place a value into the Secure Storage Component, which hashes
      to the same lpnh value found in the LocalPolicy they want to replay. Normally
      there is a single LPN valid on the system—except during software updates, when
      two are simultaneously valid—to allow for the possibility of falling back to
      booting the old software in the event of an update error. When any LocalPolicy
      for any operating system is changed, all policies are re-signed with the new
      lpnh value corresponding to the new LPN found in the Secure Storage Component.
      This change happens when the user changes security settings or creates new operating
      systems with a new LocalPolicy for each.

    description: The nsih field represents an SHA384 hash of the Image4 manifest data
      structure that describes the booted macOS. The macOS Image4 manifest contains
      measurements for all the boot objects—such as iBoot, the static trust cache,
      device tree, Boot Kernel Collection, and signed system volume (SSV) volume root
      hash. When LLB is directed to boot a given macOS, it’s designed to ensure that
      the hash of the macOS Image4 manifest attached to iBoot matches what’s captured
      in the nsih field of the LocalPolicy. In this way, the nsih captures the user
      intention of what operating system the user has created a LocalPolicy for. Users
      change the nsih value implicitly when they perform a software update.

      excluding nonces, in order to give a consistent measurement over time (because
      nonces like lpnh are frequently updated). The prot field, which is found only
      in each macOS LocalPolicy, provides a pairing to indicate the recoveryOS LocalPolicy
      that corresponds to the macOS LocalPolicy.

      in the LocalPolicy for system recoveryOS. It’s updated when the system recoveryOS
      is updated, such as on software updates. A separate nonce from the lpnh and
      rpnh is used so that when a device is put into a disabled state by Find My,
      existing operating systems can be disabled (by removing their LPN and RPN from
      the Secure Storage Component), while still leaving the system recoveryOS bootable.
      In this way, the operating systems can be re-enabled when the system owner proves
      their control over the system by putting in their iCloud password used for the
      Find My account. This change happens when a user updates the system recoveryOS
      or creates new operating systems.

      dongles used for video conversion on the Mac.  It was simplest for the device
      to lack NAND and simply receive the firmware from a host on power-up.  FTAB
      files are fully ready to run blobs often including RTKit OS based memory images.

      way to a Git repository, where every file is included in the tree of the folder
      and so on up to the root node. The root node is validated against the corresponding
      `root_hash`.  The inclusion of the merkle tree allows for discovery of where
      the system volume's data is broken, as the root_hash can only tell you if it
      is broken.
